# Make Atom.io look like a real app

I'm a huge fan of @Espressoapp, but since the feature set of the app hasn't improved significantly during the last years, I've switched to Atom.io. But Atom.io looks really strange and alien-like the first time you started. So I customized the look'n'feel with existing themes, packages, and added my own CSS customizations in the ```style.less``` file.

## Dependencies

- *UI Theme*: Yosemite Unity 
- *Syntax Theme*: Atom Espresso Soda

## Preview

## How to

Install the dependencies first, and then open your ```style.less``` file in ```~/.atom```.
